# Task 1 - Data Cleanin Preprocessing
#### Aim: Learning how to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning using relevant tools and libraries of Python including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn.

# **Introduction**
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset — one of the most widely used beginner datasets for practicing data science. Real-world data is often messy, incomplete, or inconsistent. Before applying any machine learning models, it’s essential to prepare the data properly so that the model can learn meaningful patterns.
