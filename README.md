# Task 1 - Data Cleaning Preprocessing
#### Aim: Learning how to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning using relevant tools and libraries of Python including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn.

# **Introduction**
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset. Real-world data is often messy, incomplete, or inconsistent. Before applying any machine learning models, itâ€™s essential to prepare the data properly so that the model can learn meaningful patterns.

In this project, I performed several preprocessing tasks, including:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical values
- Scaling numerical data
- Visualizing survival statistics

  The steps taken reflect the real world challenges faced in data cleaning and lay a solid foundation for building predictive models in later stages.
